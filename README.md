A minimalistic music player, designed for simplicity. Built on electron, uses Howler for handling music playback, AngularJS and Bootstrap for the frontend, and jsmediatags to retrieve the ID3 tags. 

This can also serve as a starting point to impliment your own front-end/UI to the Player.

### NEW!
Now toggle between Light and Dark modes, you have to restart the application for the change to take place. (still in beta)
